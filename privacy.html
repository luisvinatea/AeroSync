    <h1>AeraSync Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: April 02, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to AeraSync, a tool designed to calculate aerator performance for shrimp ponds. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use our application. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to handling your information responsibly.</p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you use AeraSync and opt-in to data collection by checking the consent box, we may collect the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Input Data:</strong> Values you enter into the calculator, such as temperature, salinity, horsepower, volume, T10, T70, electricity cost, aerator brand, and type.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent Status:</strong> Whether you agreed to data collection for research purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information (e.g., name, email, or location) unless you voluntarily provide it (e.g., in the "Brand" field), and even then, it is not linked to your identity.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>Your data is used solely for research purposes to improve AeraSync and understand aerator performance trends in aquaculture. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To analyze aggregate trends in calculator inputs and results.</li>
      <li>To enhance the accuracy and functionality of the tool.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell, share, or distribute your data to third parties for marketing or any other purpose beyond research.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Data collected is stored securely in accordance with applicable laws. We implement reasonable measures to protect it from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <p>Data collection is optional. You can use AeraSync without consenting to data collection by leaving the consent checkbox unchecked. If you consent, you may revoke it at any time by contacting us (see below), though previously collected data may remain in aggregated, anonymized form.</p>

    <h2>Legal Compliance</h2>
    <p>We comply with applicable data protection laws, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) where relevant. If you are in a region with specific privacy rights (e.g., EU), you may have the right to access, correct, or delete your data.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or wish to exercise your rights, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:luisvinatea@icloud.com">luisvinatea@icloud.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted here, and the "Last Updated" date will reflect the latest revision. Please check back periodically.</p>
